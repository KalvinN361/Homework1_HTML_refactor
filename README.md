# Homework-1---HTML-Refactor
The objective of this project was to make the website more accessable for all types of users without affecting the website functionality and appearance.

## What was done in the Homework-1
I removed all the '<div> and </div>' tags and put sematic html elements in their place on the page.
Next, I added alternative text names for each of the images sourced within the page. 
The last thing I did was clean up the repetative code within the css file. I did this by unifying the repetative code into class styles. 

## Updated version of the webpage
The more accessable version of the website can be found on my github [here](https://kalvinn361.github.io/Homework1_HTML_refactor/)
